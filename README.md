# ios-nyt-search-proj


This is an application created using XCode for an Introduction to iOS Development course, using language Swift.
It is a New York Times app that allows the user to search for NYT articles, using the NY Times API to retrieve articles to implement search functionality. This can filter out keywords using string matches. A UICollectionView will be shown after user inputs keywords, with articles as each cell. If the user taps on an article, this will present another ViewController which expands into a snippet of the article, and a clickable link to the entire article.

To use, user should have XCode. Open the nyt_search_app.xcworkspace file and not the nyt_search_app.xcodeproj file, and run.
